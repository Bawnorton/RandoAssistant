## The Red Book
Inside the survival inventory, there is a new book next to the recipe book. This is the loot table tracking book.

### Loot Table Tracking
- The book will automatically track loot tables that have been found in the world.
  - This includes block breaking, entity killing, fishing, chest looting, and more.
  - The book will also track recipes you have crafted and blocks you interact with in the world.
    - This includes stripping logs, waxing copper, and more.
    - Crafting recipes and interactions are tracked so that you can see the paths you took to get to a specific item.
- All tracking is done via a custom implementation of the in-game statistics system so there is no need to worry about data loss.
  - **Consequently, unless this mod is installed server-side, the book will not be able to track loot tables as statistics are stored server-side.**

### Red Book Display
- The red book will open up a new widget to the right of the inventory, closing the recipe book if it is open.
  - This widget will contain a list of every loot table that has been discovered, i.e. the loot table to get diamonds.
  - Each loot table entry will have a preview of "Best Source == Number of Steps ==&gt; Target Item"
    - The "Best Source" is the block, entity or recipe that is naturally found (if possible) and has the least number of steps to get to the target item.
  - Clicking on a loot table entry will open up that loot table's graph above the inventory.
- There is a settings button in the top right which will take you to the mod's settings.

### Loot Table Graph
- The loot table graph will show the target item you selected in the red book.
  - In the top left, there will be an icon indicating what your current target item is and a compass which you can click to re-center the graph on the target item.
  - The graph will contain nodes and arrows connecting the nodes.
    - **Right-click a node to highlight the path from that node to the target item.**
    - Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.

## Settings
The settings menu can be accessed by clicking the settings button in the top right of the red book.
- **Unbroken Stars** (default: `on`)
  - Display star icons on unbroken blocks
- **Silk-Touch Stars** (default: `on`)
  - Display star icons on broken but not silk-touched blocks
  - Requires **Unbroken Stars** to be `on`
- **Enable Override** (default: `off`)
  - Enable all undiscovered loot tables
  - This is not permanent and can be disabled at any time
- **Randomize Colours** (default: `off`)
  - Randomize world and entity colours (Cosmetic)
- **Search Depth** (default: `6`)
  - The maximum number of steps to search for a path to the target item
  - Increasing this will increase the size of the graph and time it takes to generate the graph, thus, values over 15 are not recommended
- **Highlight Radius** (default `5`)
    - The radius for how many blocks (that are unbroken) are highlighted when holding down the highlight key (default `v`)
    - Values over 10 are not recommended when surrounded by a lot of unbroken blocks as highlighting blocks is somewhat intensive
